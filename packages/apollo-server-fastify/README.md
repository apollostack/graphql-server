This is the Fastify integration of GraphQL Server. Apollo Server is a community-maintained open-source GraphQL server that works with many Node.js HTTP server frameworks. [Read the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). [Read the CHANGELOG.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

```shell
npm install apollo-server-fastify graphql
```

## Fastify

```js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-fastify');
const { typeDefs, resolvers } = require('./module');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

const app = require('fastify')();

(async function () {
  await server.start();
  app.register(server.createHandler());
  await app.listen(3000);
})();
```

* **Simplicity**: by keeping things simple, GraphQL Server is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure
* **Performance**: GraphQL Server is well-tested and production-ready - no modifications needed
